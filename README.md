Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to analyze customer churn in a bank, identifying patterns and factors contributing to customers leaving the bank. The insights aimed to help the bank develop strategies to retain customers and improve satisfaction.

Data Source:
The dataset comprised bank customer information, including demographics, account details, transaction history, and previous interactions with the bank.

Key Steps and Methodologies:

Data Collection and Preparation:

Imported data into Power BI from various sources such as Excel, CSV, and database systems.
Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
Data Modeling:

Created relationships between tables to ensure a coherent data model.
Defined calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for deeper insights.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of data and key variables affecting churn.
Used Power BI visuals like histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to explore data.
Visualization:

Developed interactive dashboards with various visuals:
Churn Rate Overview: Displaying overall churn rate and trends over time.
Customer Segmentation: Segmenting customers based on demographics, account types, and other relevant factors.
Churn Drivers: Highlighting key factors influencing churn such as age, account balance, and transaction frequency.
Geographic Analysis: Using maps to show churn rates by regions.
Key Insights:

Identified high-risk customer segments with higher churn rates.
Discovered significant factors contributing to churn, such as low account balances and infrequent transactions.
Provided actionable recommendations to the bank for targeted retention strategies.
Interactivity and User Experience:

Enabled slicers and filters to allow users to interact with the data and drill down into specific segments.
Used tooltips and detailed labels to enhance data interpretation.
Report Sharing:

Published the report to the Power BI Service for secure sharing and collaboration.
Set up scheduled data refresh to ensure the report reflects the latest data.
Tools and Technologies:
Power BI Desktop for report development and visualization.
Power Query for data transformation.
DAX for creating measures and calculated columns.
Power BI Service for publishing and sharing the reports.
Conclusion:
The churn analysis project provided valuable insights into customer behavior and churn patterns, enabling the bank to make data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention and satisfaction. The interactive Power BI dashboards allowed stakeholders to explore the data dynamically and identify key areas for improvement.
